","body":"### Welcome to A Management System (AMS)\r\nThis is a AMP (Apache/Php/MySQL) project and utilizes Twitter Bootstrap as the front-end framework. The [AMS GitHub project](https://github.com/CrandellWS/ams/) is freely available for download and distribution under the MIT License, and has been developed by William Crandell (@CrandellWS).\r\n\r\n### Installation Guide\r\nCopy all files from the htdocs folder into either the root directory or subfolder of the web server. \r\n\r\nA MySQL database and user will firstly need to be created. AMS needs to be configured with information of the MySQL host, database name, username, and correlating password. This information is to be inserted into these 3 files /includes/config.php, /install/index.php, and /resetpw.php. \r\n\r\nDepending on the server configuration, you may need to set the defined variable AMS_SEO_URL found in includes/defines.php. You also may want to change the AMS_SITE_NAME in this location. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the .htaccess file will need the RewriteBase set to the correct location.\r\n\r\nFYI, the installation script is on the roadmap to recovery, and becoming a better script by automating these configurations.  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
